## Creepers Gonna Creep

# Description
Creepers Gonna Creep is a Minecraft Bukkit plugin that lets ops prank their users by making them spawn creepers occasionally when they move. Whether or not a creeper spawns is determined by a probability bestowed upon the user. Use a low probability (0.005 ish) to give the user an occasional heart attack and make them wonder why they have such bad luck. Use anything over 0.01 to crash the server :D

Written by Andrew (SpikeMeister/Spike) as a test to become more familiar with the Bukkit API and writing plugins for MineCraft. Feedback welcome.
