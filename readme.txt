## Creepers Gonna Creep

# Description
Creepers Gonna Creep is a Minecraft Bukkit plugin that lets ops prank their users by spawning creepers around them randomly when they move. The frequency of creeper spawns is determined by a probability bestowed upon each user. Use a low probability (0.005 ish) to give the user an occasional heart attack and make them wonder why they have such bad luck. Use anything over 0.001 to crash the server :D

I mainly wrote this to familiarise myself with the Bukkit API and put to use the things I have learned in my OO class the last few months. I welcome feedback on the source.
